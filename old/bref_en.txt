Hej,

My name is Mikael and I'm applying for the position of Data engineer. I originate from Reykjav√≠k, Iceland and currently live there but I have lived in Uppsala, Sweden before. I found the job ad on glassdoor.com and the job description got me interested.

A little info about me: I have been programming professionally for 5 years, first for University of Iceland for a research project then as a backend engineer for the flight search engine Dohop. I moved to Uppsala in 2015 and got my masters degree from Uppsala University with a focus on graph analysis in C++11. I've moved back to Iceland after my graduation and worked briefly for Marorka as a Data engineer. At Marorka I designed and deployed an ETL pipeline using Apache Kafka, Kafka streams with Docker, Zookeeper and the Confluent platform but I'm currently looking for other opportunities.

I'm mostly interested in data collection (ETL design) and analysis, backend systems development and maintenance. I feel mostly comfortable working in a Linux ecosystem and I have experience working in the cloud with AWS. I have experience writing code in Python, Java, R, C++11 and C#. I'm experienced with many database technologies such as MySQL, postgres, MSSQL, redis, Kafka and managed databases such as AWS DynamoDB or AWS RDS.

I'm comfortable working in a team (have Agile/Scrum training) but I'm also capable of working independently. I'm a quick to pick up new concepts and fast to produce working code.    

In my spare time I'm mostly interested in reading about new technology, cycling, lifting and cooking. I also enjoy travel and getting to know new cultures. I am also an active blood donor.

Thank you for reading my letter and I hope to hear from you back.

All the best,
Mikael Dubik.
